形式如下：

早起的坏处
Rare is the chief executive who extols the virtues of a lie-in. Tim Cook, boss of Apple, maker of the iPhone, wakes between 4am and 5am. So does Bob Iger, his counterpart at Disney, a media giant. According to one survey, two-thirds of the chief executives of large American companies are up by 6 o’clock; for average Americans the share is less than one in three. For those aspiring to corporate greatness, the message seems clear: you snooze, you lose.

extol /ɪkˈstəʊl/ 赞美，颂扬。例句：She always extols the hard work and dedication of her students.（她总是赞美她学生的努力和奉献。）
a lie-in 睡懒觉
snooze /snuːz/ 打盹，小睡。例句：I like to snooze for a few minutes after my alarm goes off in the morning.（早上闹钟响过后，我喜欢再打盹几分钟。）


早起的坏处
Early birds are certainly held in higher regard. Rolling into the office late continues to be frowned upon in most workplaces. A study published in 2022 by Jessica Dietch of Oregon State University and her co-authors found that night owls were perceived by respondents as being “lazy”, “undisciplined” and “immature”. To pile on the stereotypes, they are fatter, too, according to research by Lap Ah Tse of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and colleagues.

Be held in high regard受到高度评价
To pile on the stereotypes 让刻板印象更加根深蒂固的是


印度经济
The National Stock Exchange of India is now neck-and-neck with Hong Kong’s stock exchange for the title of the world’s seventh-largest bourse.

neck-and-neck with 竞争者非常接近，没有明显的领先者，通常用来形容竞争激烈，双方势均力敌，无法预测最终结果。


印度经济
The first is that India should stop fetishizing manufacturing—an obsession born of East Asia’s growth miracle. In the 1960s India’s income per person was on a par with that of China and South Korea. By 1990 South Korea had taken off, while India remained level with China. Today China is three times richer and South Korea is seven times richer, adjusted for purchasing power.

Fetishising ['fɛtɪʃaɪzɪŋ] 将...奉为神物，过分迷恋，过分崇拜。例句：He was accused of fetishising violence in his artwork.（他因为在艺术作品中过分迷恋暴力而受到指责。）


印度经济
The bigger problem is that India appears to get little bang for its buck. By the latter half of high school, around half of students have dropped out. Bosses report that many of those who graduate are still not ready for work. Getting a new business off the ground is such a nightmare that many startups incorporate in Singapore. Labour laws make workers difficult to sack once they have been employed for more than a year, which incentivises the use of intermittent contracts. 

get little bang for its buck得不到相应的回报。bang指的是火药引爆时的声音，buck则是指代投资。
Sack [sæk] 麻袋，大袋子；解雇，开除。例句：The company decided to sack several employees due to budget cuts.（由于预算削减，公司决定解雇几名员工。）


印度经济
Politicians should start, they write, by jettisoning protectionism. From 1991, when India opened up to global markets, to 2014, when Mr Modi took power, average tariff levels fell from 125% to 13%. They have since risen to 18%, raising the cost of intermediate inputs for producers. 

Jettison ['dʒɛtɪsn] 抛弃，丢弃。例句：In order to lighten the load, they had to jettison some of the cargo from the ship.（为了减轻负荷，他们不得不从船上抛弃一些货物。）


印度经济
A better governed, more open India would be wonderful. But whether their ambitions are politically feasible is another question. For example, better public services probably mean devolving power from the central and state governments to localities.

Devolve [dɪˈvɒlv] 逐渐转移，逐渐转变。例句：The conversation devolved into an argument.（对话逐渐转变为争吵。）
